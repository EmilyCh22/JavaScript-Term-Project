This is the homepage for my bird-lover puzzle games!

"Puzzles"
--> This is a jigsaw puzzle game where you can choose which image you want (from a selection)
    and it'll be split into a grid where you then have to drag and drop the pieces
    to put it back together in the way that it originally was.

"Word Search"
--> Like any other word search, there will be a grid of letters that have words hidden
    in-between, and you'll have to find the words from the given list of bird-related words.

"Birdcage"
--> This is my fun little spin on the classic 'Hangman', but instead of hanging a stick figure,
    you'll have to guess the letters correctly to set the birds free from their cages.
    If you run out of guesses, the birds will stay locked in the cages forever!
    --or not if you want to try again. :P

any input or feedback is greatly appreciated!
