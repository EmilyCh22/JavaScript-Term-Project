Welcome to the collection of my three bird web games!


*** "Puzzle Perch" (jigsaw puzzles) ***

How to Play:
>   Start by choosing a photo from the selection shown above the puzzle board.
    Then you may choose how many pieces you want, ranging from 3x3 (very easy) to 7x7 (very challenging).
    The cut-up image will appear--in pieces--in the top left corner.
    You must drag each piece to its correct position to create a complete image.
    Basic directions can be found below the puzzle board.

Current Issues:
>   The script doesn't check if the completed picture is correct,
    so you have to trust your judgement when making the puzzle(s).

Potential Bug Fixes:
>   Add a system that checks if the image is correct, and if it is, alert the player
    and let them either reload the tab or choose another image to restart the game.

Future Releases:
>   I may add a feature that allows the user to import their own image
    (and either crop it or resize it to fit the canvas).

*** "Words of a Feather" (word search) ***
How to Play:
>   A list of 6 random, bird-related words will be chosen from a premade list.
    You must find those six words placed [horizontally] throughout the 10x10 grid.
    Once you locate a word in the grid, click it and enter the word!
    Upon finding all the words, you will be prompted to reload the tab to restart the game.
    There is no time or guess limit, so keep searching until all the words have been found!
    Basic directions can be found below the Word List.

Current Issues:
>   The system of play relies on trusting that the user won't
    simply enter each word in without looking through the grid.
>   The words can only be placed horizontally,
    which doesn't allow for much of a challenge.
>   

Potential Bug Fixes:
>   Add a feature/system that makes it so the user must click on the word itself
    before typing it in, or else it'll tell them there's no word where they clicked.
    Also 
>   Add a feature that allows words to be placed vertically as well
    (and possibly diagonally, too).
    
Future Releases:
>   I could add difficulty levels (which can affect the grid size, number of words, length of words. )
>   (may be too complicated (for me)) Change the word finding system so that the user can
    click and drag the word instead of typing it in.

*** "Birdcage" (hangman) ***
How to Play:
>   This game is my take on hangman, but using birds trapped in cages instead of the classic stick figure.
    It starts off with a random word selected from a premade list, and each blank has a cage on it.
    To guess a letter, simply click one of the buttons displayed below the blanks.
    With each letter guessed correctly, the spot(s) will be filled in with that letter and
    a bird overhead, representing the bird being freed from its respective cage.
    The remaining incorrect guesses display below the letter buttons, and each incorrect guess
    decreases the number by one.
    Basic directions can be found below the incorrect guess count/message box.

Current Issues:
>   The cages/birds could be reworked (visually).

Potential Bug Fixes:
>   Add an animation for the bird(s) flying out of the cage(s) when freed.

Future Releases:
>   I could add difficulty levels that would most likely just affect the number of guesses,
    but it could also choose from a list of longer (and super short?) words.
